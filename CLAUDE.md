# CLAUDE.md — AI Assistant Guide for OOOI Pilot Logbook PWA

## Project Overview

**OOOI** is a professional pilot logbook Progressive Web App named after the four critical flight times: Out, Off, On, In. It is an offline-first PWA with cloud synchronization, passkey-based authentication, and OCR capabilities for digitizing handwritten logbook entries.

Deployed on **Vercel** and synced from [v0.app](https://v0.app/chat/eXgJay4h1Jy).

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) with React 19 |
| Language | TypeScript 5 (strict mode) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 with OKLch color space |
| UI Components | shadcn/ui (New York style) + Radix UI primitives |
| Icons | Lucide React |
| Local DB | Dexie (IndexedDB wrapper) |
| Cloud DB | MongoDB 6 |
| Auth | WebAuthn passkeys + TOTP 2FA |
| Data Fetching | SWR + Dexie React hooks |
| Forms | Custom hooks (`useFormSubmit`, `useCrewForm`) — no form library |
| OCR | @gutenye/ocr-browser with ONNX Runtime |
| Charts | Recharts |
| Package Manager | pnpm (not npm) |
| Bundler | Webpack (not Turbopack) |

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # Start dev server (Next.js with Webpack)
pnpm build        # Production build (8GB heap for OCR models)
pnpm lint         # Run ESLint
pnpm start        # Run production server
pnpm install      # Install dependencies (MUST use pnpm, not npm)
```

**Important:** This project uses **pnpm** as its package manager. Vercel deploys with `frozen-lockfile`, so the `pnpm-lock.yaml` must stay in sync with `package.json`. **Never use `npm install`** to add dependencies — always use `pnpm add <package>` (or `pnpm add -D <package>` for dev deps). Using npm will only update `package-lock.json` and the Vercel build will fail.

There is no test framework configured. No Jest, Vitest, or Playwright.

## Architecture

### Offline-First with Dual Database

All user data is stored locally in **IndexedDB via Dexie** and synced to **MongoDB** when online. This means:

- Data hooks read from Dexie first, not the server
- Mutations write to Dexie and enqueue a sync item
- The sync engine batches and pushes changes to MongoDB
- Last-write-wins conflict resolution. The delta-pull watermark is **server-authored**:
  `/api/sync/[collection]` filters on the server-assigned `syncedAt` and returns
  the server clock as the new `since`, so device clock skew can't drop updates.
  The client only advances `lastSyncTime` when every collection pulled cleanly.
- Tombstone records track deletions to prevent re-syncing. On the server, the
  tombstone is written **before** the record is deleted (in `/api/sync/bulk`) —
  if the tombstone write fails the delete is skipped and the client retries, so
  a deletion can never be applied without a tombstone (which would resurrect the
  record on other devices).
- Failed push items are retried each cycle and **dead-lettered** after
  `MAX_SYNC_RETRIES` (5) so a poison item can't loop forever; transient
  network/offline failures are not counted toward the cap.

### Sync Triggers

Sync runs automatically on: app focus, network online, debounced data changes (2-5s), manual trigger, and pre-logout.

**Initialization is auth-driven, not mount-driven.** `SyncProvider`
(`components/providers/sync-provider.tsx`) is mounted once at the root and never
remounts across login/logout (those are route changes). It watches
`useAuth().user`: when `userId` becomes non-null — on a boot-with-session **or
any later login** — it calls `initializeTriggers()` and runs an initial
`fullSync()`; when `userId` goes null (logout) it tears the triggers down so the
next login re-initializes cleanly. A `syncedUserId` ref ensures this fires only
on a real user transition (a callsign change or silent reauth keeps the same
`userId`, so it does not resync). Do **not** revert this to a one-shot
`getUserSession()` check at mount — that skips the initial sync *and the
triggers* whenever the app is cold-opened logged-out and the user then logs in
(only the manual sync button worked).

**Per-collection dispatch** (delete/upsert from the server) goes through the
single `COLLECTION_HANDLERS` registry in `sync-service.ts`, keyed by the closed
`SyncCollection` union — add a collection in one compile-checked place, not in
parallel switch/if-else chains.


### Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**: Create callsign → server issues WebAuthn challenge (stores `userId`/`callsign`/`totpSecret` on the challenge doc with `type: "registration"`) → register passkey → `register/complete` consumes the challenge and creates the user from the **server-authored** values (it does not trust client-supplied `userId`/`callsign`/`totpSecret`) → setup TOTP
2. **Login**: server issues WebAuthn challenge → passkey assertion is **cryptographically verified** server-side via `verifyAuthenticationResponse` (challenge binding in `clientDataJSON` + signature against the stored public key + ceremony type) → optional TOTP → session cookie
3. **Silent reauth**: On page load, checks session → if expired, attempts passkey silent auth (same server-side verification)

**Auth security invariants (do not regress):**
- Every passkey login **must** call `verifyAuthenticationResponse` before issuing a session — never trust a `credential.id` lookup alone (credential IDs are not secret). `register/complete` and `register/add-passkey` likewise bind the attestation by checking `clientDataJSON.type === "webauthn.create"` and a matching challenge.
- Challenges are **single-use**: consume them with `findOneAndDelete` (type + expiry checked) so they can't be replayed.
- The WebAuthn signature counter is enforced as strictly-increasing **only when a counter is in use** (either side non-zero) — synced/platform passkeys report `signCount 0` permanently and must not be locked out on their second use.
- TOTP is **single-use**: verify with `verifyTOTPWithCounter` and reject any code whose time-step `counter <= auth.lastTotpCounter` (shared across the TOTP login and callsign-change endpoints). Compare codes in constant time.

Sessions are stored in MongoDB (with TTL) and mirrored to IndexedDB. Cookies are HttpOnly + Secure + SameSite=Lax. Each session row also stores the request **`userAgent`** (set in `issueSession`) so the account page can label active sessions by device.

**Session reactivity & resync interception** (`auth-provider.tsx`):
- A global **session monitor** revalidates `/api/auth/session` on focus, visibility, network-online, an `auth:unauthorized` event, and a slow interval, flipping a reactive **`sessionExpired`** flag so a session revoked elsewhere is reflected without a manual refresh. The route guard sends a logged-in-but-expired user through the custom login flow (keeping local data).
- The sync engine emits `auth:unauthorized` on any 401, and a **locally-expired** session attempts reauth (custom passkey flow) instead of a silent no-op — this is why a manual resync against a dead session now actually prompts re-auth. `ensureValidSession()` gates the manual sync button: it revalidates, runs passkey reauth if needed, and only then syncs. Do **not** restore the silent early-return on expiry.

**Step-up auth** (`lib/auth/server/step-up.ts`): sensitive account actions are gated behind a fresh passkey assertion. `GET /api/account/step-up` issues a user-bound single-use challenge; `verifyStepUpAssertion` verifies it with the same `verifyAuthenticationResponse` path (and advances the counter). Used to **reveal the TOTP seed/QR** (`/api/account/totp/reveal` — never served without it) so a user who lost their authenticator can re-add it, and as an **alternative to TOTP** for changing the callsign.

**Per-device passkeys:** each passkey stores the registering browser's opaque `deviceId` (`getOrCreateDeviceId`, sent on register/add-passkey). The account page uses it to show "Add passkey for this device" vs "This device already has a passkey" (instead of letting `navigator.credentials.create` throw `InvalidStateError` on a duplicate — which is also caught gracefully everywhere as a no-op).

### Shared Reference Data System

Aircraft and airport reference data is managed through a multi-tier lookup and enrichment pipeline:

**Data Sources:**
- **Aircraft Database** (IndexedDB `referenceDb.aircraftDatabase`): there is **no** bulk CDN download. The table is populated on demand from FR24 search results, custom user entries, and the shared MongoDB enriched pool synced via `/api/sync/aircraft-reference` (per-user cursor)
- **Airport Database**: Loaded from `public/airports.min.json` into IndexedDB
- **ICAO DOC 8643 Aircraft Types**: Loaded from `public/aircraft-types.json` with memory + IndexedDB two-level caching
- **FR24 APIs** (live): Aircraft search via `/v1/search/web/find`, airport lookup via `/airports/traffic-stats/`
- **Server Enrichment DB** (MongoDB): User-submitted aircraft/airports enriched and shared across users

**Lookup Chain (aircraft):**
1. Local IndexedDB (`referenceDb.aircraftDatabase`) — FR24 + custom + MongoDB-synced records in one unified table
2. Server batch lookup (`/api/search/aircraft/batch`) — checks enriched submissions from other users
3. FR24 live search (`/api/search/aircraft`) — server-side proxy to bypass CORS
4. Manual entry (user types registration + type code)

**Lookup Chain (airport):**
1. Local IndexedDB (`referenceDb.airports`) — includes static + custom airports
2. FR24 live search (`/api/search/airport`) — server-side proxy for airport details
3. Manual entry (user types ICAO + details)

**Enrichment Pipeline:**
- Custom aircraft/airports are submitted fire-and-forget to `/api/submissions/aircraft` or `/api/submissions/airport`
- Server attempts real-time enrichment (FR24 for aircraft, geo-tz for airports)
- Failed enrichments are retried by `/api/enrichment/batch` (cron, max 3 retries)
- Enriched data is shared across all users via batch lookup API

**Form UX Pattern:**
- User enters registration (aircraft) or ICAO code (airport)
- Debounced search (500ms) checks: local DB → FR24
- If found: auto-populates all fields, hides manual input fields (transparent to user)
- If not found: reveals manual input fields for user entry
- Duplicate detection prevents re-adding existing records

**Key Functions:**
- `addCustomAircraftToDatabase(record)` — writes to unified IndexedDB table
- `getAircraftByRegistrationFromDB(reg)` — O(1) lookup via registration map
- `batchGetAircraftByRegistrations(regs)` — bulk lookup for CSV imports
- `submitAircraftToServer()` / `submitAirportToServer()` — fire-and-forget enrichment
- `searchAircraftTypes(query, limit)` — ICAO DOC 8643 type code search
- `normalizeRegistration(reg)` (`lib/utils/string.ts`) — the **single canonical**
  registration key: uppercases and strips **all** non-alphanumeric characters.
  Used identically on the client (local matching) and server (the
  `registrationNormalized` dedup key). Do not reintroduce per-file copies.
- `recalculateFlightFields()` — respects `manualOverrides`, won't overwrite user's manual entries

### Component Architecture

- Root layout is server-rendered; app content uses `"use client"`
- Context providers: Auth, Sync, Theme (root level), ScrollNavbar (app level)
- `KeepAlivePages` wraps page content in `app/(app)/layout.tsx`, keeping heavy list pages mounted across navigations (see below)
- Desktop uses split-panel layout (sidebar + detail panel via `react-resizable-panels`)
- Mobile uses bottom navbar with swipeable interactions
- Responsive switching via `useIsDesktop()` hook

### Swipe-to-Reveal Rows (`components/swipeable-card.tsx`)

`SwipeableCard` is the single reusable swipe-to-reveal primitive used app-wide
(flight/crew/aircraft lists, the flight form's field rows, and the crew/aircraft
detail rows). Built on **framer-motion** (motion values → no per-frame React
re-renders).

- **Gesture:** `drag="x"` with `dragDirectionLock` + `touchAction: "pan-y"` — a
  vertical gesture scrolls the list natively and never fights the horizontal
  swipe. Release settles to open/closed with a spring (`SPRING`); a fast flick
  opens via velocity.
- **Actions** (`SwipeAction[]`): rendered as **separate, rounded buttons** that
  **scale/pop in** (spring, staggered, trailing first) and fill the row height.
  Buttons rest at `opacity 0` when closed so nothing peeks at the edge. The
  trailing button sits **flush** with the card's right edge; the left gap comes
  from `openWidth` via `justify-end` (the panel has no padding, so it collapses
  to true 0 width when closed). `icon` is optional (label-only actions like
  "Clear" are allowed). Destructive **delete/logout** actions are **icon-only**
  app-wide — omit `label` and set `ariaLabel` for accessibility (don't reintroduce
  visible "Delete"/"Revoke" text).
- **Hold-to-confirm** (`holdToConfirm`): a tap does **not** fire the action.
  Instead the panel closes and a **confirm overlay** covers the row — the content
  behind is greyscaled + slightly blurred + black-tinted ("the past"), a
  translucent pill ("Hold to confirm") sits centred, and a progress border
  (`HoldProgressBorder`) traces the **card** from 12 o'clock clockwise as you
  press-and-hold (2.5s default). The pill fills with a soft red left→right
  gradient and shrinks slightly. Releasing early just **resets**; it's dismissed
  only by tapping **outside** the card (a capture-phase `pointerdown`) or
  swiping. Dragging is disabled while the overlay is up. There is **no** red
  full-row fill anymore.
- **Variants:** `variant="card"` (default — standalone rounded card) and
  `variant="row"` (inline divider row inside a grouped `FormSection`). A
  swiped `row` **morphs** into a rounded, lifted card (`bg-secondary`).
- **Dividers** (`separated` prop): inset `.row-divider` pseudo-element (see
  `globals.css`) aligned to the row's `px-4` text, **not** full width. On morph,
  the dividers directly above and below the swiped row fade out via
  `[data-swipe-active]` + `:has(+ …)` rules. The pseudo-element uses `z-index:2`
  so it shows above the `z-[1]` swipeable content (otherwise wrapped/editable
  rows would hide it).
- **Tap vs drag:** a capture-phase guard swallows the click synthesised at the
  end of a drag and closes an open row instead of navigating. On a clean tap with
  no `onClick`, the card focuses a blended inline `input`/`textarea` inside it
  (those inputs are `pointer-events:none` via the `[data-swipe-row] input` rule,
  so a swipe can start over them).
- **Multi-card:** opening/tapping one card closes others via the
  `swipe-card-close-others` window event.
- **No full-swipe:** there is intentionally **no** "swipe past N% to auto-trigger
  the primary action" behaviour — it was removed. Actions fire only on button tap.

### Motion Primitives & Navigation Animation

- **`components/ui/hold-to-confirm-button.tsx`** (`HoldToConfirmButton`) — the
  shared press-and-hold confirm control (used by the swipe confirm overlay and
  the account "Log out of all devices" button). Built on
  `hooks/use-hold-to-confirm.ts` (a `MotionValue` progress 0→1 via rAF). The fill
  is a soft red left→right gradient revealed by a CSS mask; an optional
  `HoldProgressBorder` draws the perimeter. Accepts an external `progress`
  MotionValue so a surrounding surface can advance in lock-step. `showBorder={false}`
  when the surrounding element owns the border (the swipe overlay puts the border
  on the card, not the pill).
- **`components/ui/hold-progress-border.tsx`** (`HoldProgressBorder` +
  `topCenterRoundedRectPath`) — an SVG rounded-rect stroke that draws from **12
  o'clock clockwise** (custom path; a `<rect>` starts at a corner), thickening,
  glowing and intensifying with `progress`. Uses a per-instance (`useId`)
  gradient stroke. Sized to its positioned parent via a ResizeObserver.
- **`components/ui/border-glide.tsx`** (`BorderGlide`) — a glowing segment that
  **glides around** the rounded border (a "border beam"), used on the TOTP login
  OTP group while verifying. The full-border "confirmed" glow stays via the
  `.totp-success` box-shadow.
- **Gravity nav indicator** (`GravityIndicator` in `components/nav-pill.tsx`) —
  the active-tab/​item highlight blob (pill bar + bottom nav + sidebar). It moves
  via a **CSS `transform` transition** (compositor-driven), NOT a Framer/JS spring
  — Framer springs tick on the main thread and **hitch** when a heavy page
  (dashboard/FDP) mounts. Position uses a bouncy overshoot bezier; size settles a
  touch faster for a subtle stretch. Tab metrics are measured with a
  ResizeObserver in **content coordinates** (so it's correct inside the scrollable
  sidebar). Do **not** revert this to a Framer `animate()`/motion-value spring.
- **Nav morph** (`useMorphPhase` + `DesktopPillMorph`/`MobilePillMorph`) — the
  pill ↔ sidebar morph is a single continuous `opening`/`closing` transition
  (position + width + height move **together**), not the old slide-then-expand
  two-step (which felt "stuck"). The pill/sidebar **content** is hidden during
  the morph and only **eases in** once fully settled (`phase === "pill"` /
  `"sidebar"`), so you never see squished content mid-morph.

### Unified Settings/Form Layout

Flight, crew, and aircraft detail/forms share one visual system so they look
identical:

- **`components/ui/form-section.tsx`** — `FormSection` renders the grouped card
  (`rounded-xl bg-card border`) with an optional uppercase section header. Rows
  go directly inside and bring their own `px-4` (so dividers/actions span the
  full card width).
- **`components/ui/settings-row.tsx`** — shared `SettingsRow` / `ToggleRow` /
  `ReadOnlyRow` (`px-4 py-3.5`, inset `row-divider`). Editable `SettingsRow`s are
  swipe-to-clear (wrapped in `SwipeableCard variant="row" separated`). Inline
  inputs are styled to **blend** like the flight form's "Flight #" field —
  `border-0 bg-transparent dark:bg-transparent shadow-none rounded-none
  md:text-base` (no box, same font size in edit mode).
- **Crew dedupe:** `hooks/use-crew-form.tsx` (`useCrewForm`) owns all crew form
  state + persistence; `components/crew-form-body.tsx` (`CrewFormBody`) is the
  shared presentational body. `components/crew-detail-panel.tsx` (desktop panel,
  glass actions) and `app/(app)/crew/[id]/page.tsx` (full page, incl. "new"
  mode) are thin chrome wrappers around them — navigation is delegated via the
  hook's `onSaved` callback.
- The flight form (`components/flight-form.tsx`) keeps its own inline row
  primitives and complex auto-save/calculation logic, but its `SwipeableRow`
  wraps the shared `SwipeableCard` and its rows use the same `.row-divider`.

### KeepAlive Navigation

Four heavy pages are kept mounted across navigations for instant tab-switching and scroll preservation:

**Persistent pages** (`components/keep-alive-pages.tsx`):
- `/logbook`, `/aircraft`, `/airports`, `/crew` — lazy-imported via `React.lazy()`, mounted on first visit, never unmounted
- All other pages (currencies, roster, etc.) unmount normally via Next.js `children`

**How it works:**
- `KeepAlivePages` wraps `children` in `app/(app)/layout.tsx`
- Persistent pages are stacked with `position: absolute; inset: 0` inside a relative container
- Active page: `visibility: visible`, `pointer-events: auto`, `z-index: 1`
- Inactive pages: `visibility: hidden`, `pointer-events: none`, `z-index: 0`
- `bg-background` on each container prevents one-frame overlap flash during transitions
- Focus management: blurs any focused element inside a hidden page on route change

**Why `visibility:hidden` not `display:none`:**
`display:none` removes elements from layout, resetting `scrollTop` to 0 and breaking `@tanstack/react-virtual` measurements. `visibility:hidden` keeps elements in the layout tree, preserving scroll positions and container dimensions.

**Why not cache Next.js `children`:**
Next.js wraps pages in internal `LayoutRouter` components that unmount contents on navigation — caching the element tree doesn't prevent remounting.

**`usePageActive(routeKey, onActivated?)` hook** (`hooks/use-page-active.tsx`):
- Each persistent page calls this to detect when it becomes the active route
- Returns `isActive` boolean
- Fires `onActivated()` callback only on inactive→active transitions (not initial mount)
- Used to re-sync detail panel content when returning to a page

**Detail panel integration** (`hooks/use-detail-panel.tsx`):
- `DetailPanelProvider` tracks `KEEPALIVE_ROUTES` — does NOT clear `detailContent` when navigating between two keep-alive routes
- Each persistent page re-syncs its detail panel via its `usePageActive` callback (`syncDetailPanel`)
- Selections stored in `sessionStorage` for restoration across full page reloads

**Provider hierarchy:**
```
AppLayout → ScrollNavbarProvider → SidebarProvider → DetailPanelProvider
  → AppShell → KeepAlivePages
    ├── /logbook, /aircraft, /airports, /crew (lazy, persistent)
    └── children (other routes, normal unmount)
```

### State Management

| State Type | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Persistent user data | Dexie (IndexedDB) |
| Server cache | SWR with Dexie fetcher |
| Auth & sync status | React Context API |
| Transient UI state | React useState |
| URL-driven state | URL search params |

## Naming Conventions

| Kind | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Components | PascalCase | `FlightList`, `DutyEntryCard` |
| Hooks | camelCase with `use` prefix | `useFlights`, `useDBReady` |
| Functions | camelCase | `addFlight`, `fetchFlights` |
| Types/Interfaces | PascalCase | `FlightLog`, `Aircraft` |
| Constants | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE | `CACHE_VERSION`, `PRECACHE_ASSETS` |
| Component files | kebab-case `.tsx` | `flight-list.tsx`, `duty-entry-card.tsx` |
| Hook files | camelCase `.ts` | `useFlights.ts`, `use-db.ts` |
| Store files | kebab-case `.store.ts` | `flights.store.ts` |
| Type files | kebab-case `.types.ts` | `flight.types.ts` |

## Import Aliases

Configured in `tsconfig.json`:

```typescript
@/*            → ./*           // General alias
@/types/*      → ./types/*     // Type definitions
@/lib/*        → ./lib/*       // Utilities & services
@/hooks/*      → ./hooks/*     // Custom hooks
@/components/* → ./components/* // React components
@/config/*     → ./config/*    // Configuration
```

Always use these aliases instead of relative paths.

## Key Patterns

### Data Hooks

Data hooks in `hooks/data/` use SWR backed by Dexie:

```typescript
// Pattern: hook reads from Dexie, mutations write to Dexie + enqueue sync
const { flights, isLoading } = useFlights();
```

### Forms

Forms use lightweight custom hooks (`hooks/use-form-submit.ts`, `hooks/use-crew-form.tsx`) for submission/loading/error state rather than a form library. Validation is hand-rolled where needed. There is no React Hook Form or Zod dependency.

### API Routes

Server-side routes in `app/api/` follow Next.js App Router conventions with `route.ts` files exporting HTTP method handlers (`GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`).

Notable route groups:

| Route | Method | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/search/aircraft?q=` | GET | No | FR24 aircraft search proxy |
| `/api/search/aircraft/batch` | POST | No | Batch lookup from enriched MongoDB |
| `/api/search/airport?q=` | GET | No | FR24 airport lookup proxy |
| `/api/submissions/aircraft` | POST | Yes | Submit custom aircraft for enrichment |
| `/api/submissions/airport` | POST | Yes | Submit custom airport for enrichment |
| `/api/enrichment/batch` | POST | CRON_SECRET (required) | Background enrichment of pending submissions; fails closed if `CRON_SECRET` is unset |
| `/api/timezone?lat=&lng=` | GET | No | Coordinate → IANA timezone via geo-tz |
| `/api/account/step-up` | GET | Yes | Issue a user-bound single-use WebAuthn challenge for step-up |
| `/api/account/totp/reveal` | POST | Yes (passkey step-up) | Reveal the TOTP seed + otpauth URI to re-add an authenticator |
| `/api/account/callsign` | PUT | Yes (passkey step-up **or** TOTP) | Change callsign |
| `/api/account/sessions` | GET/DELETE | Yes | List sessions (with device `userAgent`); revoke one (incl. current) or all |

### Console Logging

Debug logs use prefixed format: `[v0]`, `[Auth]`, `[SW]`, `[UserDB]`, `[Sync]`, etc.

## Configuration Notes

- **Webpack** is used explicitly (`--webpack` flag), not Turbopack
- **TypeScript build errors are ignored** (`ignoreBuildErrors: true` in next.config.mjs)
- **ESLint errors are ignored during build** (`eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds: true`) — lint runs only via `pnpm lint`, never blocking a Vercel deploy (mirrors the TS setting)
- **8GB heap** allocated for builds due to OCR model processing
- **shadcn/ui** uses the New York style with CSS variables and RSC support
- **Tailwind CSS v4** via `@tailwindcss/postcss` PostCSS plugin
- **Dark mode** is class-based via `next-themes`
- **Fonts**: **Inter** (`--font-sans`) and **Geist Mono** (`--font-mono`, for
  `tabular-nums` numbers) are both loaded via a single Google Fonts `<link>` in
  `app/layout.tsx`. Geist Mono **must stay loaded** — `--font-mono` references it,
  so dropping the link makes every `font-mono` element fall back to an
  inconsistent system monospace. Keep app text on Inter/Geist Mono; the only
  deliberate exception is the FDP "next reporting time" (`font-serif italic`).

## Linting

ESLint uses a **flat config** (`eslint.config.mjs`) that spreads
`eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals` **directly** — `eslint-config-next@16`
ships native flat-config arrays, so wrapping them in `FlatCompat` double-wraps
the plugins and throws a "Converting circular structure to JSON" error. `eslint`
and `eslint-config-next` are declared devDependencies (keep `pnpm-lock.yaml` in
sync; Vercel uses frozen-lockfile). `pnpm lint` should stay **green (0 errors)**.

### The advisory react-hooks v6 warnings (~54, intentionally `warn`)

Next 16 bundles **`eslint-plugin-react-hooks` v6**, which ships the **React
Compiler** rule suite (`set-state-in-effect`, `refs`, `immutability`, `purity`,
`static-components`, `incompatible-library`). This codebase predates the
compiler, so these fire on patterns that are **correct in standard React**. They
are downgraded to **warnings** in `eslint.config.mjs` on purpose — do **not**
re-promote them to errors or mass-refactor to silence them. The classic
load-bearing rules (`rules-of-hooks`, `exhaustive-deps`) keep their default
severities.

Why each is left (they are resolvable, but the fix is a real refactor with
regression risk, and several are false positives for our constraints):

- **`set-state-in-effect`** — flags SSR-hydration effects (read `localStorage`
  then `setState`, which *must* be post-mount, e.g. `use-sidebar-context`) and
  reset-on-prop-change effects. "Compliant" rewrites mean `useSyncExternalStore`
  / derived state per hook — easy to introduce hydration mismatches.
- **`refs`** — flags the deliberate `ref.current = latest` write during render
  (e.g. `use-page-actions`) used to avoid effect-dependency churn / button
  flicker. The "fix" reintroduces the flicker.
- **`incompatible-library`** — `@tanstack/react-virtual`; not fixable in our code.
- **`immutability` / `purity`** — conservative compiler analysis (e.g. the login
  TOTP auto-submit effect); not real mutations.
- **`static-components`** — a Recharts `content={<CustomTooltip/>}` defined in
  render (closes over theme); hoisting means threading every prop back through.
- **`@next/next/no-page-custom-font`** — Inter is loaded via a Google Fonts
  `<link>`; the family is hardcoded in a Tailwind v4 `@theme` block, so a
  `next/font` migration is fiddly and risks a wrong font shipping.

When **genuinely** missing a stable dep (a `useCallback`/`useMemo`/router/setState
dispatcher), add it. When excluding a dep is intentional (the flight-form
re-init/auto-save effects keyed on `resolvedFlight?.id` — depending on the full
object clobbers in-progress edits on every reactive Dexie write), add an
`// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` **with a rationale**.

Clearing the remaining warnings is a deliberate "adopt the React Compiler"
project, individually tested — not a piecemeal lint cleanup.

**New code, however, must not add new advisory warnings** — write it
compiler-clean and keep the ~54 baseline as a cap (`pnpm lint` should not grow).
In practice: put `setState` inside callbacks / event handlers / subscription or
timeout callbacks rather than synchronously in an effect body, derive state
instead of effect-then-setState, and avoid `useLiveQuery` in new components
(read counts via an async effect + the sync `onDataChanged` subscription, as
`components/first-sync-splash.tsx` does).

## Environment Variables

- `MONGODB_URI` — MongoDB connection string (required)

## Known Issues & Deferred Work

### FDP / roster legality calculations (DEFERRED — needs domain review before changing)

A subsystem audit surfaced three issues in `lib/utils/roster/fdp-calculator.ts`.
These drive the **legality/limits dashboard**, so they are intentionally left
untouched until reviewed with the user — a wrong "fix" to regulatory math is
worse than the current behavior. Do **not** change these casually.

1. **Rolling-limit windows mix UTC and local date parsing** (`~:787`).
   `calculateRollingStats` parses duty dates with `new Date(dp.date +
   "T00:00:00")` (runtime-local TZ), but callers build the as-of date in UTC
   (`generateTimelineData ~:1080`, `simulateScenario ~:1560`,
   `simulateHypotheticalDuty ~:1354` all use `…T23:59:59Z`), while
   `forecastExceedances ~:928` uses local `…T23:59:59`. For a non-UTC user
   (the app targets SGT/UTC+8) a duty period on the inclusive/exclusive window
   boundary can be silently included or excluded. Fix is to settle on one date
   convention end-to-end.
2. **`includesLocalNight` ignores a past-midnight debrief** (`~:641-668`, called
   from `calculateRestPeriod ~:711`). The raw `previous.debriefTime` + un-wrapped
   `previous.date` are passed even when the prior duty crossed midnight, so the
   rest-window night test runs against the wrong day → wrong rest rule (3a vs 3b).
   `calculateRestPeriod` already wraps `prevDebriefAbsolute` for the rest-minutes
   math but not before this call.
3. **`mergeAdjacentDutyPeriods` drops the long-sector FDP adjustment**
   (`~:499-503`). The merged-duty max-FDP recompute omits `longestSectorMinutes`
   (the `DutyPeriod` type doesn't even carry it), so `applyLongSectorAdjustment`
   never runs on a merged overnight duty — an over-long merged duty can read as
   compliant.

### Lower-priority items (not yet actioned)

- **`discrepancies.resolved` boolean secondary index** (`lib/db/user-db.ts`) —
  IndexedDB can't key a boolean, so the index is inert (same class as the
  airports `isFavorite` bug already fixed). Not a live bug today (all readers use
  `.filter()`, not `.where()`), but removing it needs a Dexie version bump, so
  it's deferred. Do **not** add a `where("resolved")` query against it.
- **Logbook CSV `remarks`** (`lib/utils/parsers/logbook-parser-v2.ts:224-225`) —
  `synthType` and `remarks` both read `cols[17]`. Confirmed against the real
  Scoot "Crew Logbook Report" export: that format has **18 columns and no
  remarks column** (col 16/17 are SYNTH. DEVICES Time/Type). So this is harmless
  redundancy, not data loss — left as-is.
- **Crew logbook CSV times are UTC** (`logbook-parser-v2.ts` ~:62-63) — verified
  by cross-referencing the crew logbook export against the three **labeled**
  schedule reports (UTC / Local Base / Local Station) for the same flights: the
  logbook's dep/arr times match the **UTC** report exactly (e.g. 02/04 SIN→BKK
  `04:49→07:22`; 03/04 SIN→CJB arrival `17:13`, and `17:13 UTC + 5:30 = 22:43` =
  the Local-Station CJB local arrival). So storing them verbatim as UTC (the
  parser's `// logbook is already UTC` comment) is **correct** — there is no
  local→UTC conversion to apply here, unlike the schedule report which carries an
  explicit time-frame header and is normalized via `time-reference-normalizer`.
  (An earlier audit guessed these were local station times; that was a false
  positive.)
- **Service worker** (`public/sw.js`) — three items needing offline testing
  before any change (a bad SW is hard to roll back): (1) `install` calls
  `self.skipWaiting()` unconditionally while the registration
  (`hooks/use-service-worker.ts`) is built around an update-*prompt* flow, so
  the prompt is effectively dead and a background update can auto-reload the page
  mid-edit (auto-save mitigates data loss); (2) `DYNAMIC_CACHE` has no cap —
  per-flight `/flights/<id>` shells accumulate unbounded until a `CACHE_VERSION`
  bump; (3) the Strategy-6 catch-all caches any cross-origin `ok` GET (no
  same-origin guard). All are latent/hardening, not active data bugs.

## PWA Details

- **Service worker** (`public/sw.js`): precaches static assets, login page, and OCR models; runtime caches app routes and CDN resources; versioned caches (v4)
- **Manifest** (`public/manifest.json`): standalone display mode, window controls overlay for desktop
- **Offline fallback**: full offline operation with cached data; `offline.html` as last resort
- **OCR models** (~16MB): cached by service worker after first load

## Database Schema

### User Database (Dexie — `userDb`)

| Table | Purpose | Key Indexes |
|---|---|---|
| `flights` | Flight log entries | id, date, syncStatus, aircraftReg, userId |
| `aircraft` | Aircraft records | id, registration, type, userId |
| `personnel` | Crew members | id, name, userId, crewId |
| `preferences` | User settings | key |
| `syncQueue` | Pending sync items | id, collection, timestamp |
| `syncMeta` | Sync metadata | key |
| `userSession` | Local session mirror | id |
| `scheduleEntries` | Roster schedule | id, date, dutyType |
| `currencies` | Certificate tracking | id, code, expiryDate, syncStatus |
| `discrepancies` | Schedule conflicts | id, type, resolved |

### Reference Database (Dexie — `referenceDb`)

| Table | Purpose | Key Indexes |
|---|---|---|
| `airports` | Airport reference data (~10k) | icao, iata, [icao+iata] |
| `aircraftDatabase` | Unified aircraft DB (FR24 + custom + MongoDB-synced enriched) | icao24, registration |
| `aircraftTypes` | ICAO DOC 8643 type designators | designator |
| `metadata` | Version tracking for cache invalidation | key |

### MongoDB Collections (server-side)

| Collection | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `aircraftSubmissions` | User-submitted aircraft with enrichment status (pending/enriched/failed) |
| `airportSubmissions` | User-submitted airports with enrichment status |
| `sessions` | User sessions with TTL |
| `deletions` | Tombstones (TTL 30d) for propagating deletes across devices |
| `flights`, `aircraft`, `personnel`, etc. | Synced user data collections |

**Indexes:** `lib/mongodb/client.ts` runs an idempotent, best-effort
`ensureIndexes()` once per warm process after `connect()` — `{userId,id}` (unique)
and `{userId,syncedAt}` on the data collections, the `deletions` TTL/dedup/delta
indexes, and unique dedup indexes on the submission collections. (The
`/api/sync/setup-ttl` route still creates the `deletions` indexes too.) Index
creation is fire-and-forget and never blocks a query; a failure (e.g. a
pre-existing duplicate blocking a unique index) is logged, not thrown.

## Critical Files

When making changes, be aware of these high-impact files:

**Core Infrastructure:**
- `app/layout.tsx` — Root layout, provider hierarchy, PWA preloaders
- `app/(app)/layout.tsx` — Authenticated app layout, responsive nav
- `lib/db/user-db.ts` — Dexie user database schema (schema changes affect migrations)
- `lib/sync/sync-service.ts` — Core sync logic (changes affect data integrity)
- `components/providers/auth-provider.tsx` — Auth context, login/logout flows
- `components/providers/sync-provider.tsx` — Sync initialization (auth-driven: (re)initializes triggers + initial sync when a user logs in, tears down on logout)
- `public/sw.js` — Service worker caching strategies
- `lib/mongodb/client.ts` — MongoDB connection pool (shared across API routes)

**Navigation & Keep-Alive:**
- `components/keep-alive-pages.tsx` — Persistent page shell (changes affect all four main pages)
- `hooks/use-page-active.tsx` — Active route context and `usePageActive` hook
- `hooks/use-detail-panel.tsx` — Detail panel provider (keep-alive route awareness)
- `components/desktop-layout.tsx` — Responsive app shell (sidebar + detail panel)

**Swipe & Forms:**
- `components/swipeable-card.tsx` — The single swipe-to-reveal primitive (framer-motion). Used by all lists, the flight form rows, and the crew/aircraft detail rows.
- `components/ui/form-section.tsx` — Shared grouped section card + header.
- `components/ui/settings-row.tsx` — Shared `SettingsRow`/`ToggleRow`/`ReadOnlyRow` (inset divider, blended inline inputs, swipe-to-clear).
- `hooks/use-crew-form.tsx` + `components/crew-form-body.tsx` — Shared crew form state + body (crew detail panel and `[id]` page are thin wrappers).
- `app/globals.css` — `.row-divider` inset divider rules, `[data-swipe-active]` morph rules, and `[data-swipe-row] input` pointer-events rule (changing these affects every swipe row).

**Reference Data System:**
- `lib/db/reference-db.ts` — Dexie reference database schema (airports, aircraft, types)
- `lib/db/stores/reference/aircraft.store.ts` — unified aircraft reference store (FR24 + custom + MongoDB-synced; no CDN download)
- `lib/db/stores/reference/airports.store.ts` — Airport reference data, favorites, timezone utilities
- `lib/db/stores/reference/aircraft-types.store.ts` — ICAO DOC 8643 type designator lookup
- `lib/submissions/submit.ts` — Fire-and-forget client→server submission with flight reconciliation
- `lib/utils/aircraft-type-utils.ts` — ICAO type code parsing (description → category/engines)
- `components/aircraft-new-form.tsx` — Aircraft creation form with FR24 auto-populate
- `components/airport-new-form.tsx` — Airport creation form with FR24 auto-populate
- `lib/utils/string.ts` — `normalizeRegistration` canonical registration key (shared client/server)

## Things to Avoid

- Do not introduce Turbopack — the project explicitly uses Webpack due to OCR/ONNX compatibility
- Do not add a test framework without discussion — none exists currently
- Do not modify the Dexie schema without considering IndexedDB migration implications
- Do not change sync conflict resolution strategy without understanding the tombstone system
- Do not gate `SyncProvider`'s init on a one-shot `getUserSession()` check at mount — drive it off `useAuth().user` so a login *after* mount (cold-open-logged-out, or logout→login) still initializes triggers and runs the initial sync
- Do not re-fork the per-collection delete/upsert dispatch into switch/if-else chains — extend the single `COLLECTION_HANDLERS` registry in `sync-service.ts` instead
- Do not advance the sync watermark from the client clock — `lastSyncTime` must come from the server-returned `syncedAt`, and only after every collection pulls cleanly
- Do not delete a record on the server before its tombstone is written (`/api/sync/bulk`) — that order prevents deleted records resurrecting on other devices
- Do not issue a session from a passkey route without calling `verifyAuthenticationResponse` — a `credential.id` lookup is not proof of possession (credential IDs aren't secret). Same for `register/complete`/`add-passkey`: bind the attestation to the server-issued challenge (`webauthn.create` + matching challenge)
- Do not trust client-supplied `userId`/`callsign`/`totpSecret` in `register/complete` — read them from the consumed server-issued challenge doc
- Do not re-tighten the WebAuthn counter check to always-strict — synced/platform passkeys report `signCount 0` forever; only enforce strict increase when a counter is in use (either side non-zero)
- Do not accept a TOTP code without the `auth.lastTotpCounter` replay check, and keep the OTP comparison constant-time (`verifyTOTPWithCounter`)
- Do not reintroduce per-file registration normalizers — use the canonical `normalizeRegistration` in `lib/utils/string.ts` on both client and server
- Do not re-add a bulk CDN aircraft download — the aircraft DB is populated from FR24, custom entries, and the MongoDB enriched pool only
- Do not remove `"use client"` directives — server/client boundary is intentionally designed
- Do not commit `.env` files or MongoDB credentials
- Do not use `npm install` or `npm add` — always use `pnpm` to keep `pnpm-lock.yaml` in sync (Vercel uses frozen-lockfile)
- Do not expose FR24 as the data source in UI — the user explicitly requires online lookups to be transparent (no "Online Results" labels, no Globe icons, no "FlightRadar24" branding)
- Do not add hexdb.io fallback for aircraft lookup — if FR24 fails, manual entry is the only option
- Do not bypass `recalculateFlightFields()` `manualOverrides` — users' manually entered field values must never be overwritten by enrichment
- Do not add pages to `PERSISTENT_PAGES` in `keep-alive-pages.tsx` without considering memory impact — only heavy virtualized pages should be persistent
- Do not use `display:none` for hiding keep-alive pages — `visibility:hidden` is required to preserve scroll positions and virtualizer measurements
- Do not re-add swipe "full-swipe to auto-trigger the primary action" to `SwipeableCard` — it was intentionally removed; actions fire only on button tap
- Do not make a `holdToConfirm` action fire on tap, dismiss the confirm overlay on release, or bring back the red full-row fill — the overlay is dismissed only by an outside tap/swipe, release just resets, and the destructive cue is the card progress border + the pill's gradient fill
- Do not animate the gravity nav indicator with a Framer/JS spring — it must use a CSS `transform` transition (compositor) or it hitches when a heavy page mounts. Likewise don't restore the slide-then-expand two-step morph or show the pill/sidebar content mid-morph (it must ease in only when settled)
- Do not re-gate the dashboard rings / FDP chart behind a deferred-animation flag — the blob is compositor-driven now, so the charts can animate freely
- Do not drop the Geist Mono Google-Fonts `<link>` — `--font-mono` depends on it; without it `font-mono` falls back to an inconsistent system monospace
- Do not give `register/complete`, `add-passkey`, the callsign change, or the TOTP-reveal routes a path that skips `verifyAuthenticationResponse`/`verifyStepUpAssertion` — the TOTP seed must never be revealed without a fresh passkey step-up
- Do not give `SwipeableCard` action panels horizontal padding — the panel must collapse to 0 width when closed (the left gap comes from `openWidth`/`justify-end`), otherwise a sliver of the action button peeks at the card edge
- Do not put row dividers as a full-width `border-b` — use the inset `.row-divider` class so the line aligns with the `px-4` text
- Do not give inline form inputs a visible box — keep `border-0 bg-transparent dark:bg-transparent shadow-none rounded-none` so they blend with the row (and `md:text-base` so the font doesn't shrink in edit mode)
- Do not hardcode `orange-400` for scheduled flight cards — light and dark themes use separate colors (`orange-600` light / `orange-400` dark) for contrast
